==About Portage 
----
Portage is a package management system originally created
for and used by Gentoo Linux,and Funtoo Linux among others.

Portage is based on concept of ports collections. Gentoo is 
sometimes referred to as a meta-distribuition due to the 
extremely flexibility of Portage,which makes it operating-system
independent.

The Gentoo is concerned with using Portage to manage other
operating systems,such as BSDs,macOS and Solaris,the most
notable of these implementation is the Gentoo/FreeBSD project.

There is an ongoing effort called the Package Manager Specification
(PMS),which aims to standardise and document the behaviour of
Portage,allowing the ebuild tree and Gentoo system packages 
to be used with alternative package managers such as Paludis 
and pkgcore. Its goal is to specify the exact set of features
and behaviour of package manager and ebuilds,serving as an
authoritative reference for Portage.
